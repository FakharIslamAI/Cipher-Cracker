# Affine Cipher Decryption Algorithm

This C++ implementation offers a robust decryption tool for the Affine Cipher, a classical substitution cipher. The algorithm takes user-provided plaintext and ciphertext pairs, deduces the key, and decrypts the message. It also includes a utility to calculate the multiplicative inverse needed for decryption. 

## How to Use

1. **Compile**: Compile the `encryptionAlgorithm.cpp` file using a C++ compiler.
2. **Execute**: Run the compiled executable.
3. **Input**: Provide plaintext and ciphertext pairs as instructed.
4. **Output**: The program outputs the decryption keys and the decrypted message.

## Features

- **Efficient Decryption**: Utilizes the Affine Cipher decryption algorithm for fast and accurate message decoding.
- **Dynamic Input**: Allows user input for plaintext and ciphertext pairs, making it versatile for various messages.
- **Multiplicative Inverse Calculation**: Automatically calculates the multiplicative inverse required for decryption.

## Getting Started

To get started with this implementation, simply download or clone the repository and compile the `encryptionAlgorithm.cpp` file. Follow the instructions provided by the program for decrypting your messages.
